# Docusaurus Prompt POC

```text
## Purpose/Objective

Create a Docusaurus status website to present the information, topic, presentation, research, guidance - in a categorized way to allow for attendees at a Microsoft Technical conference to access and continue learning about the topics presented in a single conference talk - but allow them to have the details, information, how things were done and setup, the behind the scenes research, access to a list of resources. 

## Instructions

Can you create a prompt that will utilize a target set of content (i.e., markdown files) via searching recursively in a set of target folders... and create for me a Docusaurus static web site...

The prompt should be descriptive enough for Copilot to automatically create a new Docusaurus site, extract the content, categorized and structure the content, create content files in markdown, build and serve a working site. 

Use all of the content, research, chat, presentation information contained in these markdown documents. 

The Docusaurus site should be well organized by topic and category. You have liberty to do some additional research on some topics to make them more complete to meet the purpose/objective.

Create a categorized resource list of items related to the topics with links to the resources.
