**You:**

My talk proposal was just accepted to present at the next Microsoft Denver developer day. I would like you to review the title and description of the talk. I have about 50 minutes to deliver. I‚Äôm pretty sure this will be mostly a demo type talk where I actually show and interact with copilot within visual studio code kind of a soup do nuts type presentation starting with some initial concepts For beginners and go through the talk to show some of the advanced capabilities, different use cases in order to integrate copilot and visual studio code into your development process, etc.

Please provide me with some research about the current capabilities of the tool, conventional use case cases, innovative ways, different companies developers are using this product. Maybe a brief history of the product would be good, etc..

Title:   Beyond Autocomplete: Mastering AI Pair Programming with GitHub Copilot

Description
Tired of writing boilerplate and repetitive code? This session dives deep into GitHub Copilot, the AI pair programmer that works alongside you in Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio. Through live coding demos, we‚Äôll show how Copilot can translate natural language prompts into code, suggest entire functions, and even filter out common errors by recommending best practices. Whether you‚Äôre new to AI tools or already using Copilot, you‚Äôll learn techniques to get more from it and avoid common pitfalls.What You‚Äôll Learn: How to integrate Copilot into your daily workflow for rapid development, tips for crafting prompts to generate better code suggestions, and strategies to use Copilot for documentation and unit tests generation. We‚Äôll also share insights from the latest research (GitHub‚Äôs studies show developers using Copilot complete tasks 55% faster) to highlight why AI-assisted coding is transforming development.By the end of this session, you‚Äôll understand how to pair with Copilot effectively to improve productivity and code quality. Why it matters: As AI becomes a standard part of the developer toolkit, mastering Copilot means writing better code with less work ‚Äì a boost for both new and experienced developers in building reliable, maintainable systems.

**ChatGPT:**

Congrats on getting accepted to speak at Microsoft Denver Developer Day ‚Äî that‚Äôs a big deal! Your title and abstract are already very strong, but I‚Äôll give you a full review with some polish, plus provide research to support the demo-rich talk. Here's the breakdown:

* * *

## ‚úÖ TITLE REVIEW

**Current Title:**

> **Beyond Autocomplete: Mastering AI Pair Programming with GitHub Copilot**

**Feedback:**

* Excellent. ‚ÄúBeyond Autocomplete‚Äù is a great hook.

* ‚ÄúMastering AI Pair Programming‚Äù clearly sets the level of depth and direction.

* It‚Äôs appealing to both curious beginners and seasoned devs.

**Optional Tweaks (only if you want variety):**

* _"Coding with Copilot: From Prompt to Production"_ (emphasizes real-world use)

* _"From Typing to Guiding: Mastering GitHub Copilot as Your AI Pair"_ (more narrative)

* But again ‚Äî your original works great.
