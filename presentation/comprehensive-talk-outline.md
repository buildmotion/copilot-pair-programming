## üìö Foundation & Context (8 minutes)

### What is GitHub Copilot?

- **AI-powered coding assistant** from GitHub & OpenAI *(Microsoft's $7.5B investment at work)*
- **Trained on billions of lines** of "public" code *(wink wink)*
- **Integrated directly** into your IDE *(because why leave when they know everything about you?)*
- **Context-aware**: Reads your project like it's gossip *(and probably judges your naming conventions)*

<!-- 
Speaker Notes:
- *deadpan delivery* "It's not magic, folks - it's just trained on billions of lines of code from GitHub repositories. You know... all that code you uploaded thinking it was 'private'?" *pause for effect* 
- *slight smirk* "Microsoft bought GitHub in 2018 for 7.5 billion. Wonder how they got all that sweet, sweet training data, right?? I'm just saying..." *shrug*
- *lean forward conspiratorially* "This isn't your grandpa's IntelliSense. This thing reads your entire project like it's binge-watching Netflix - understands your imports, your patterns, probably judges your variable names..."
- *raise eyebrow* "They say it's 'context-aware.' Translation: it knows when you're about to write another nested ternary operator and judges you accordingly"
- *serious tone shift* "But seriously though - this isn't glorified autocomplete. It's an AI that understands coding context better than most developers understand their own codebase" 
- *back to snark* "Built on GPT architecture - you know, the same tech that confidently tells you there are 11 letters in 'strawberry.' But hey, at least it writes clean code!"
- *pause* "Supports 40+ programming languages... because apparently JavaScript wasn't enough suffering for one lifetime" *wait for laughs*
- *timing note: pause after each snarky comment to let it land, then transition smoothly to next point*
