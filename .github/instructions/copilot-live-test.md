# Live Copilot Instruction Test

This file tests whether Copilot follows our presentation instructions in real-time.

---

## Test 1: Write about GitHub Copilot's autocomplete feature

<!-- 
Copilot: Write a bullet point about GitHub Copilot's autocomplete feature 
following our snarky presentation style guidelines. Avoid expectation-subversion patterns.
-->

**Expected:** Direct, solar statement with snark
**Anti-Pattern Check:** Should NOT contain "isn't just" or "more than just"

---

## Test 2: Describe AI pair programming benefits

<!-- 
Copilot: Explain why developers love GitHub Copilot using our Bill Burr + Dave Chappelle energy.
Be specific, avoid corporate fluff, use active voice.
-->

**Expected:** Snarky but accurate technical benefits
**Anti-Pattern Check:** Should NOT contain "in today's fast-paced world" or passive voice

---

## Test 3: Comment on Microsoft's AI strategy

<!-- 
Copilot: Write speaker notes about Microsoft's AI acquisition strategy with cynical humor.
Balance snark with technical accuracy. Target corporations, not developers.
-->

**Expected:** Sharp-witted corporate commentary
**Anti-Pattern Check:** Should NOT be overly formal or apologetic

---

## Test 4: Define what GitHub Copilot does

<!-- 
Copilot: Define GitHub Copilot in one sentence using our solar confidence style.
No expectation-subversion patterns. Be direct and memorable.
-->

**Expected:** "Copilot [does specific thing] and [snarky observation]"
**Anti-Pattern Check:** Should NOT use "Copilot isn't just..." structure

---

## Instructions Validation

If Copilot follows our instructions, the generated content should demonstrate:

1. ✅ **Solar Confidence**: Direct, affirmative statements
2. ✅ **Snarky Energy**: Bill Burr + Dave Chappelle + Samuel L. Jackson tone  
3. ✅ **Active Voice**: "Copilot does X" not "X is done by Copilot"
4. ✅ **Technical Accuracy**: Factually correct with comedic timing
5. ✅ **No Fluff**: Zero corporate speak or empty transitions
6. ✅ **Pattern Avoidance**: No expectation-subversion structures

---

## Results Analysis

After running these tests, we can determine:

- Whether the `applyTo` directive works
- If Copilot understands our style guidelines  
- How consistently it follows the instructions
- Which patterns it still defaults to despite instructions
