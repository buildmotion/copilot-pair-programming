# Nx Workspace Setup Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide on creating and configuring an Nx workspace for your projects.

## What is Nx?

Nx is a build system with built-in tooling and advanced CI capabilities. It helps developers build, test, and deploy multiple applications from a single codebase, making monorepo management efficient and scalable.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or later
- npm v8 or later (or yarn/pnpm)
- Git (for version control)

## Creating a New Nx Workspace

There are multiple ways to create a new Nx workspace:

### Method 1: Using npx (Recommended)

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-workspace

 NX   Let's create a new workspace [https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro]

âœ” Which stack do you want to use? Â· none
âœ” Would you like to use Prettier for code formatting? Â· Yes
âœ” Which CI provider would you like to use? Â· github

 NX   Creating your v21.2.1 workspace.

 NX   Your CI setup is almost complete.

 NX   Welcome to the Nx community! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ Star Nx on GitHub: <https://github.com/nrwl/nx>
ðŸ“¢ Stay up to date on X: <https://x.com/nxdevtools>
ðŸ’¬ Discuss Nx on Discord: <https://go.nx.dev/community>
```

During the setup process, you'll be asked to configure your workspace:

### Interactive Prompts

When you run the command, you'll be prompted to make several choices:

1. **Stack Selection**:

   ```bash
   âœ” Which stack do you want to use? Â· none
   ```

   Options include:
   - `none` - Empty workspace with no pre-configured settings
   - `react` - React applications
   - `angular` - Angular applications
   - `next.js` - Next.js applications
   - And many others depending on your needs

2. **Code Formatting**:

   ```bash
   âœ” Would you like to use Prettier for code formatting? Â· Yes
   ```

   - Recommended to choose `Yes` for consistent code formatting

3. **CI Provider**:

   ```bash
   âœ” Which CI provider would you like to use? Â· github
   ```

   Options include:
   - `github` - GitHub Actions
   - `circleci` - CircleCI
   - `azure` - Azure DevOps
   - `gitlab` - GitLab CI
   - `none` - No CI configuration

Nx will then create your workspace with the specified configuration.

### Example Output

```bash
 NX   Creating your v21.2.1 workspace.

âœ” Installing dependencies with npm
âœ” Successfully created the workspace: my-workspace.
âœ” Nx Cloud has been set up successfully
âœ” CI workflow has been generated successfully
```

## Method 2: Using Nx CLI (If Already Installed)

If you already have the Nx CLI installed globally, you can use:

```bash
nx create-workspace my-workspace
```

## Method 3: Using Package Managers Directly

### Using npm

```bash
npm init nx-workspace my-workspace
```

### Using Yarn

```bash
yarn create nx-workspace my-workspace
```

## Nx Workspace Structure

After creation, your workspace will have the following structure:

```text
my-workspace/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/                   # Application projects
â”œâ”€â”€ libs/                   # Library projects (shared code)
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/                  # Workspace-specific tooling
â”œâ”€â”€ nx.json                 # Nx configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Workspace dependencies
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.base.json      # Base TypeScript configuration
```

## Connecting to Nx Cloud

Nx Cloud provides distributed caching and task execution to speed up your builds:

```bash
 NX   Your CI setup is almost complete.

Finish it by visiting: https://cloud.nx.app/connect/[YOUR-UNIQUE-LINK]
```

Visit the provided link to connect your workspace to Nx Cloud for enhanced features.

## Adding Projects to Your Workspace

Once your workspace is set up, you can add projects using generators:

```bash
nx generate application my-app
# or
nx g app my-app
```

## Working with Your Nx Workspace

### Running Tasks

```bash
# Run a target for a specific project
nx build my-app

# Run a target for all projects
nx run-many --target=build --all
```

### Visualizing Your Workspace

```bash
# Generate a visualization of project dependencies
nx graph
```

## Enabling Nx Tools for GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot can be enhanced with Nx-specific intelligence using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Here's how to set it up:

### 1. Install VS Code Extensions

Install the Nx Console extension for VS Code:

```bash
code --install-extension nrwl.angular-console
```

### 2. Configure VS Code Settings

Create or update your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "nx.enableCopilotTools": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"
  },
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

### 3. Create GitHub Copilot Instructions

Add Nx-specific instructions for GitHub Copilot by creating a file at `.github/copilot/instructions.md`:

```markdown
---
applyTo: '**'
---

# Nx Workspace Assistance

You are in an Nx workspace using Nx [VERSION] with [PACKAGE_MANAGER] as the package manager.

## Using Nx Tools

When helping with Nx-related questions:

- Use `nx_workspace` to understand the workspace architecture
- Use `nx_docs` for configuration and best practices
- Use `nx_visualize_graph` to show project dependencies
- Use `nx_generators` to list available generators

## Generator Guidelines

When generating code:

1. Learn about the workspace with `nx_workspace` and `nx_project_details`
2. Find generators with `nx_generators`
3. Get generator details with `nx_generator_schema`
4. Open the generator UI with `nx_open_generate_ui`
5. Read logs with `nx_read_generator_log`
```

Replace `[VERSION]` with your Nx version and `[PACKAGE_MANAGER]` with your package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm).

### 4. Verify Configuration

After setting everything up, you can verify the MCP integration by:

1. Opening a file in your Nx workspace
2. Opening GitHub Copilot Chat
3. Asking an Nx-specific question like "What projects are in this workspace?"

The Copilot response should show it's using Nx tools to answer your question.

## Git Integration for Nx Workspace

When working with Nx in a team environment, it's recommended to create feature branches for your work:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new dated feature branch
git checkout -b YYYYMMDD/feature-name

# Example
git checkout -b 20250622/nx-setup
```

This naming convention helps organize branches by date and feature.
