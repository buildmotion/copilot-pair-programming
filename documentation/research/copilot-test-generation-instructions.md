# GitHub Copilot Test Generation Instructions

## Overview

The `github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions` setting in VS Code allows users to define custom guidelines for Copilot's test generation feature. This configuration is particularly useful for tailoring test generation to specific project requirements, frameworks, and coding standards.

## Example Configuration

Below is an example configuration tailored for an Nx workspace using Angular and Jest:

```json
"github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions": [
  {
    "description": "Generate unit tests for all public methods in Angular components and services within apps.",
    "file": "workspace/apps/**/*.ts"
  },
  {
    "description": "Generate unit tests for all public methods in Angular components and services within libs.",
    "file": "workspace/libs/**/*.ts"
  },
  {
    "description": "Use Jest for test generation and ensure proper mocking of dependencies in apps.",
    "file": "workspace/apps/**/*.spec.ts"
  },
  {
    "description": "Use Jest for test generation and ensure proper mocking of dependencies in libs.",
    "file": "workspace/libs/**/*.spec.ts"
  },
  {
    "description": "Include test cases for async functions and observables in apps.",
    "file": "workspace/apps/**/*.ts"
  },
  {
    "description": "Include test cases for async functions and observables in libs.",
    "file": "workspace/libs/**/*.ts"
  },
  {
    "description": "Ensure tests cover edge cases and invalid inputs in apps.",
    "file": "workspace/apps/**/*.spec.ts"
  },
  {
    "description": "Ensure tests cover edge cases and invalid inputs in libs.",
    "file": "workspace/libs/**/*.spec.ts"
  },
  {
    "description": "Use Angular TestBed for setting up components and services in tests for apps.",
    "file": "workspace/apps/**/*.spec.ts"
  },
  {
    "description": "Use Angular TestBed for setting up components and services in tests for libs.",
    "file": "workspace/libs/**/*.spec.ts"
  }
]
```
