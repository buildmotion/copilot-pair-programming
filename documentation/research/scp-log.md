## Additional Details for Explicit Instructions

To ensure Copilot follows instructions explicitly when executing the SCP command:

1. **Explicit Trigger:**
   - Type "scp" in the chat to trigger the SCP workflow.
   - Ensure Copilot is configured to recognize "scp" as a command for staging, committing, and pushing changes.

2. **Validation Steps:**

   - Check the remote repository to confirm the changes were pushed successfully.

3. **Enhancements to SCP Instructions:**
   - Include a section in the SCP instructions specifying prerequisites, such as having the GitHub MCP server running and the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` set correctly.
   - Add troubleshooting steps for common issues, such as merge conflicts or permission errors.

4. **Improving Prompts:**
   - Clearly state the desired outcome, e.g., "Execute SCP to stage, commit, and push changes."
   - Provide context about the changes being committed, e.g., "These changes update the documentation."
   - Request confirmation of successful execution, e.g., "Verify the commit in the remote repository."

## Referenced SCP.md Instructions

### Explicit Trigger

From SCP.md:
> Typing "scp" in the chat explicitly triggers the SCP workflow. Ensure that Copilot is configured to recognize this command and execute the workflow as described.

### Validation Steps

From SCP.md:

> 1. Run `git log -1` to view the latest commit and ensure it matches the generated commit message.
>
> 2. Verify that the changes have been pushed to the remote repository by checking the repository's commit history.

### Troubleshooting

From SCP.md:

> - Make sure you're using the latest version of GitHub Copilot
>
> - Try being more explicit, e.g., "Please run SCP to commit and push my changes"
>
> - If necessary, specify the branch with "scp to [branch name]"

### Enhancements
