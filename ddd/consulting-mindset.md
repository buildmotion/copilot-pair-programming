## Relational Thinking

- Understand the relationships between different entities in the system. Build trust and rapport with stakeholders,, team members, and clients.
- foster relationships
  - one-on-one meetings with team members, stakeholders, and clients
  - product owners, QA's, etc. all key players;
  - know what motivates them, what they care about, and how they work
- "It depends"
  - context matters, skills, experience, and knowledge; technology choices, design decisions, and implementation strategies
  - do not be dogmatic about a single approach or solution; erodes trust and credibility
  - super power: ask a lot of questions
    - understand the problem space, the business domain, and the needs of the users
  - be curious, open-minded, and willing to learn from others
  - "what do you think yoou should do?"
    - encourage others to share their thoughts and ideas
    - foster a culture of collaboration and innovation
  - "if you could wave a magic wand and change anything about the project, what would it be?"
    - encourage others to think creatively and outside the box
    - explore new ideas and approaches
- "I don't know, but I can find out"
  - be honest about your limitations and knowledge gaps
- "yes and..."
- Nemawashi: a Japanese term meaning "preparing the ground" or "laying the groundwork." It involves building consensus and support for a proposal before it's formally presented.
  - build relationships and trust with stakeholders
  - gather feedback and input from key players
  - build a shared understanding of the problem space and the proposed solution; build a shared vision and roadmap for the project

## Data-Driven Decisions (DDD)

- Use data to inform decisions and drive improvements.
- Collect and analyze data to understand user behavior, system performance, and business outcomes.
- Use data to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for optimization.
- Pivot based on data insights, not assumptions or gut feelings.

> Use "logging" to collect data about the system and user behavior. Use this data to inform decisions and drive improvements. Google Analytics is a great tool for this. Hotjar is another great tool for this. Use these tools to collect data about user behavior, system performance, and business outcomes. Use this data to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for optimization. DataDog is also a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing system performance.Dynatrace is another powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing system performance. Use these tools to collect data about user behavior, system performance, and business outcomes. Use this data to inform decisions and drive improvements.

Use telemetry with `Correlation IDs` to track user interactions and system events across different services and components. This can help you identify bottlenecks, troubleshoot issues, and gain insights into user behavior.

### Objective & Key Results (OKRs)

- Define clear objectives and key results to measure progress and success. Align team members around shared goals and outcomes. Teams should validate their OKRs regularly to ensure they are still relevant and aligned with the overall business strategy - validate the business impact of their work and make adjustments as needed (VALUE).
- Measurable outcomes
  - define clear objectives and key results to measure progress and success
  - align team members around shared goals and outcomes
  - validate the business impact of their work and make adjustments as needed (VALUE)

### Minimum Value Product (MVP)

- Focus on delivering the minimum viable product that meets user needs and provides value. What value does it provide to the user? What problem does it solve? What is the minimum set of features required to deliver that value?
- How do we sequentially deliver value to the user? What is the minimum set of features required to deliver that value? How do we prioritize features based on user needs and business impact?
- Use iterative development to continuously improve the product based on user feedback and data insights.

### Build vs Buy

- Evaluate whether to build custom solutions or leverage existing tools and platforms. Consider factors like cost, time, scalability, and maintainability.
- Use existing libraries, frameworks, and tools to accelerate development and reduce complexity.
- Commodity solutions may be sufficient for certain use cases, so consider off-the-shelf options when appropriate.
- Differentiate between core business logic and generic functionality. Focus on building unique features that provide a competitive advantage, while leveraging existing solutions for common tasks.

> When it is a market differentiator, build it. When it is a commodity, buy it. When it is a core business logic, build it. When it is a generic functionality, buy it. Examples: payment processing (build), user authentication (buy), data storage (buy), recommendation engine (build).

## Models

Tools solve problems, models solve complexity.

> Theory of Constraints (TOC): Identify the most critical constraint in the system and focus on improving it to achieve the greatest impact. This can help you prioritize work and drive improvements in the system.

Find the constraint in the system and focus on improving it to achieve the greatest impact. This can help you prioritize work and drive improvements in the system. Identify the most critical constraint in the system and focus on improving it to achieve the greatest impact. This can help you prioritize work and drive improvements in the system - where effort is needed.

### First Principles Thinking

- Break down complex problems into their fundamental components. Understand the underlying principles and assumptions that govern the system.
- Use first principles thinking to challenge assumptions and explore new solutions.
- Monitor and measure the impact of changes to ensure they align with the desired outcomes.
- Recognize the patterns and trends in the data to inform decision-making and drive improvements. Observe the system and identify the key drivers of performance and behavior.

### Westrums Topology

> Westrum's Topology: Understand the different types of organizational cultures and their impact on collaboration, innovation, and performance. Foster a culture that encourages learning, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

Beuracratic, Generative, Pathological, and High Reliability Organizations (HROs). Understand the different types of organizational cultures and their impact on collaboration, innovation, and performance. Foster a culture that encourages learning, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

Beauracratic organizations are characterized by rigid hierarchies, strict rules, and a focus on compliance. Generative organizations prioritize innovation, collaboration, and adaptability. Pathological organizations are reactive and blame-oriented, while High Reliability Organizations (HROs) focus on safety, resilience, and continuous learning. Learn how it operates.

### Shook's Version

> Shook's Version: Emphasize the importance of understanding the value stream and optimizing it for flow. Use value stream mapping to identify waste and improve efficiency.

Change the way you think about the system and how it operates. Understand the value stream and optimize it for flow. Use value stream mapping to identify waste and improve efficiency. Focus on delivering value to the user and continuously improving the system. Change what you do to optimize the flow of value through the system; make an impact.

## Cynefin Model

- Use the Cynefin framework to understand the complexity of the problem space and choose appropriate approaches.
- Recognize the different domains: clear, complicated, complex, chaotic, and aporetic.
- Adapt your strategies based on the domain and context of the problem.

Complex problems require adaptive approaches, while complicated problems may benefit from expert analysis. Chaotic situations demand immediate action, while clear problems can be solved with established best practices. Aporetic problems are those where the solution is not yet known or understood.

Chaotic situations require immediate action to stabilize the situation, while aporetic problems are those where the solution is not yet known or understood. Use the Cynefin framework to navigate these different domains and choose appropriate approaches. General rule is to start with the simplest solution and iterate from there.

## Mappers

Know your audience. Tailor your communication and strategies to the needs and perspectives of different stakeholders. Use empathy and active listening to understand their concerns and motivations. Who are the dependencies? Who are the stakeholders? Who are the users? Who are the customers? Who are the decision-makers? Who are the influencers? Who are the champions? Who are the detractors?

Address the needs and concerns of different stakeholders. Use empathy and active listening to understand their perspectives and motivations. Tailor your communication and strategies to resonate with different audiences. Remember who you are trying to influence and how to best communicate with them.

### Value Effort Matrix

Use the Value Effort Matrix to prioritize initiatives based on their potential value and the effort required to implement them. Focus on high-value, low-effort opportunities for quick wins, while also considering the long-term impact of more complex initiatives.

With people, consider their skills, motivations, and potential impact on the initiative. Engage stakeholders early and often to ensure their needs are met and to build support for the initiative.

With projects, consider the scope, timeline, and resources required. Use agile methodologies to iterate and adapt as needed. Target high-value, low-effort initiatives for quick wins, while also planning for the successful delivery of more complex projects over time.
