Let me know if you'd like help turning this into a slide deck or adding visuals (screenshots, diagrams, etc.).

* * *

**You:**

Yes, let‚Äôs say all of this information should be included into a slide deck. So please create a markdown file that contains all of the details information the presentation bullet points as well as the presentation talking points that would be referenced for the speaker. Make sure the referenced talking points are in markdown Comment sections so it‚Äôs not to appear when viewing the markdown document.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here is your complete slide deck content in Markdown format, with detailed speaker talking points included as hidden comments (`<!-- ... -->`). This structure is perfect for importing into a Markdown slide generator (like [Marp](https://marp.app), [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), or your own markdown-to-PDF pipeline).

# Beyond Autocomplete  
### Mastering AI Pair Programming with GitHub Copilot

<!-- 
Speaker Note:  
Welcome the audience. Introduce the concept of moving "beyond autocomplete"‚ÄîGitHub Copilot is not just a suggestion tool, it's an evolving AI pair programmer that adapts to your coding context and helps reduce grunt work while improving code quality and speed.
-->

---

## What is GitHub Copilot?

- AI-powered coding assistant from GitHub & OpenAI
- Built into VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Neovim, GitHub CLI, Mobile
- Understands context from your code, comments, and project structure
- Can write entire functions, refactor code, generate documentation, and more

<!-- 
Speaker Note:  
Set the stage by explaining that Copilot is not a magic wand, but an intelligent assistant that can reason about code context. Mention how it integrates deeply into your IDEs and is trained on billions of lines of public code.
-->

---

## Free Tier Just Launched

- Free for individuals using VS Code  
- **2,000 completions/month (~80/day)**  
- **50 Copilot Chat messages/month**
- Powered by advanced models: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Easy upgrade path to Pro for unlimited usage

<!-- 
Speaker Note:  
Big news from Dec 2024‚ÄîCopilot is now accessible for *free*. Emphasize the generosity of 2K completions and 50 chats, which is often enough for hobbyist or occasional devs.
Mention that chat uses Claude and GPT-4o, two of the most advanced models.
-->

- Understands your function, file, or entire project
- Ask for help via **inline chat**
- Use **‚ÄúEdit with Copilot‚Äù** for bulk refactors

<!-- 
Speaker Note:  
Show a live example: Create a function stub and let Copilot complete it.  
Demonstrate using `// Explain this` or selecting code and choosing `Refactor with Copilot`.  
Explain the difference between completions vs chat-based interactions.
-->
